						<h3 class="title1">BASA Project</h3>
						<p>Reading is considered to be one of the most crucial skills a child needs to learn at a young age in order to obtain progression in his or her studies and as a result be able to function well at a given work in today’s society. Apart from alternative learning plans and other educational programs of the Philippine government, one of the educational partnerships DepEd (Department of Education) has made with USAID (United States Agency for International Development) is the BASA project which is now five years completed, and has aimed to improve the literacy and reading comprehension among more than 1.8 million students. </p>

				<h3 class="title2"> The Evolution of Stories</h3>
					<p>Goodbye Homer and William Shakespeare, hello to Rick Riordan and J. K. Rowling, and of course to a bunch of other authors in our 21st century generation. Stories have changed just as all people have here in the modern times. Admittedly, there weren’t enough readers in the past mainly because books were rare to get a hold of, and were reserved for the use of the privileged. But now, reading books is free for anyone to do, and stories have become more inclusive in terms of the audience’s involvement. It has very much levelled up with the appropriate expectations considering how much stories mirrors reality. </p>
					<p>If you are curious to know more about the evolution of stories specifically the young adult genre of fiction, you can go definitely watch by clicking the button below this article for the link to the YA video presentation. </p>

					<h3 class="title3">The Pagemaster</h3>
					<p>Khristine Rocel Osoteo is an 18 year old senior highschool student who lives in San Fernando, La Union like her other fellow creators. Growing up, she has always had a fond memory of stories and books as they became her first ever companions especially when she was diagnosed with cancer, and so to this day she is continuing to pursue her dreams into becoming a writer like the authors who have influenced so much of her life for it to have changed into what it is now. Fun fact: She considers Cassandra Clare as her no.1 favorite author in her Top 5 authors’ list. Kidding! No way is there going to be just the top 5 favorite authors for her. She loves all of these twisted idealistic men and women of her inspiration. </p>
					<p>Sophia Mae Pimentel is also a fellow 18 year old fan of Cassandra Clare but she is mostly a fan of Rick Riordan, and apart from reading young adult novels, she is also invested in reading wattpad stories like The Wizard’s Tale and Project Loki. She likes to think of reading as a relaxation therapy separating her from the stress of the outside world. She did not like reading at one point in her life until she finally came around and gave herself the chance to be immersed in these recommended diverse stories. Fun fact: Whenever she is not reading, you can find her with her eyes glued to her laptop screen being an otaku and watching various animes. </p>
					<p>Ma. Lyneber Arciaga, another one of the foursome group of 18 year olds, is very much passionate when it comes to arts, specifically painting, drawing and designing her own work of dresses. That does not diminish the love of reading that she has though. She says that she loves to read because it lets her escape reality’s problems even for just a short time, and stories also makes her feel safe. Fun fact: She once submitted an artwork that used an alternative source of paint for the image of a cherubim and ladies and gents… it’s a freaking leftover coffee!!!</p>
					<p>Antonio Jeremiah Turzar, the last 18 year old among the page creators is musically inclined. Unlike the other three, while he isn’t into reading novels or stories, he more than makes up for it by playing his organ and several other instruments. He dreams of becoming a soloist for the Philippine Harmonic Orchestra someday and he does also consider taking the job and responsibility of being a counselor. Fun fact: He is an active school community member for being a pianist in school masses and church services, and also for his participation in sports like badminton, table tennis and volleyball. Talk about a productive student right there!</p>

					<h3 class="title4">School Libraries</h3>
					<p>When someone does not have enough money to buy a physical book from his or her local bookshop, he or she would resort to using the library. Libraries are a great avenue not only for finding a book that you may enjoy whether that is a classic novel or a young adult fiction or a children’s book, but it could also potentially pave the way to creating these incredible connection with people who loves reading and hanging out for the fun of sharing thoughts on stories. The Christ the King College highschool library is one of the few special places for the creators of Pagemaster’s Quill partly in consideration that they are students in the said institution, and also because of their genuine love for the books that they find themselves immersed in. Not to mention the big support of librarians, fellow students and teachers for books and reading within this school community.  </p>
					<p>Have you changed your mind yet and are considering visiting your library? For you to be motivated even more, check out the link to the button below this article and watch a Christmas themed library video made by a proud booklion from the booktube community. </p>
