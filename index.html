					<h3 class="link">Bookscreen Adaptations</h3>
					<p>2018 is definitely another year to remember especially with the amount of book to TV-movie adaptations that have come out this year. We’ve got Love Simon, The Darkest Minds, The Hate You Give, To All the Boys I Loved Before and so much more. One of the tv adaptations that we also got to see this year was A Discovery of Witches, a reknowned and beloved novel by Deborah Harkness. While more book adaptations are currently in the works, let’s check in on some other book adaptation news we got for the month of September. </p>

					<h3 class="link">Fall Book Haul</h3>
					<p>Lo and behold, 2018 surely is a year for gigantic book hauls. So much books from newly published authors and already favourite ones have to come out this year. Not to mention three epic finales from well-loved bestselling series like The Red Queen series by Victoria Aveyard coming out with its finale, War Storm, The Throne of Glass series by Sarah J. Maas coming out with Kingdom of Ash and finally The Dark Artifices series by Cassandra Clare set to come out with Queen of Air and Darkness which will have a special news discussion later on in another article. So, without further ado, let’s check in on other fall/Halloween reads from team Epic Reads to see what books we are getting for the month of October. </p>

					<h3 class="link">Cassandra Clare at Bookcon 2018</h3>
					<p>As said before from the previous October book haul, the finale to The Dark Artifices by Cassandra Clare is set to come out for the month of December. The Dark Artifices is the third series in the Shadowhunter Chronicles that Cassie Clare has published alongside her other companion novels, The Bane Chronicles and The Shadowhunter Academy. The series takes place after the events of The Mortal Instruments following a young shadowhunter named Emma Carstairs and her parabatai Julian Blackthorn in modern day Los Angeles as she embarks on a mission to find out who killed her parents during the Dark War. Lady Midnight is a book worth rereading and so is Lord of Shadows. It is the best series thus far that truly reflected how much Cassie’s writing has evolved or changed, therefore has become better over the years. It is both excitement and a torture to wait for the third and last book to come out. Will everything truly change with the shadow world? Fingers crossed, it will. To know more details from the author, watch an interview made by Michael from team Epic Reads exclusively with the one and only author, Cassandra Clare. </p>
