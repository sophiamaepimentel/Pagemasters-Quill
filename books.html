							<h3>The Valiant</h3>
				<p>The Valiant follows the story of a young girl named Fallon who is the daughter of a proud Celtic king, the sister of the legendary warrior, Sorcha and the sworn enemy of Julius Caesar. Years after her sister was slain in the battlefield by the invading army of Caesar, Fallon is on a quest to follow in the footsteps of her sister as the tribe’s next chief warrior. But unfortunately, on the eve of her seventeenth birthday, a series of events led Fallon to leave her home and get captured by slavers travelling straight into the heart of Rome, and getting sold to an elite training school for female gladiators, owned and operated by the one person she hates the most who is none other than Julius Caesar.  </p>
				<p> In this cruel twist of fate, the man who shattered Fallon’s family might be her only hope for survival. </p>
				<br>
				<p>“An action-packed read with a dash of mythology, drama and mystery… Will definitely keep you on the edge of your seats and mind you… I’ve been swearing for the majority of the pages because that’s how twisty good the story gets.” –Review by D.Diaries. group member Khristine Rocel Osoteo</p>

					<h3> The Demon's Lexicon</h3>
					<p>The story’s lore revolves around humans either being born with magical powers or making pacts with demons enabling them to have such powers. </p>
					<p>The Demon’s Lexicon is a story about two brothers, Nick and Alan Ryves, who fights demons and monsters. They are both on the run from a magician, from whom their mother supposedly stole an amulet, when they meet Mae and Jamie, who are these two troubled teenagers coming to them for help. Along the way, they all must face horror, evil, and people who just generally wants to kill them, while long kept secrets are threatening to unravel. </p>
					<br>
					<p>“For me, The Demon’s Lexicon is a story showing the complexities of what it means to give love, who’s more capable of giving love. Is it family or is it the child within a family, or potentially someone else? I definitely felt that kind of relationship with these cast of characters and how there are certain kinds of love that eventually outshines what another one has given or not…” –Review by D.Diaries. group member Sophia Mae Pimentel</p>

							<h3>Dorothy Must Die</h3>
				<p>Dorothy Must Die is a young adult retelling of the Wizard of Oz in which it follows the story of a girl from Kansas named Amy Gumm who like Dorothy met the same fate as hers when she gets swept up in a tornado and ended up in Oz. Except this version of Oz is far from the books Amy has read or from the movies she has seen. Oz is now a place turned upside down where the good witches can’t be trusted and the wicked witches may just be the good guys. Oz is now a place almost leeched of all magic, where even the yellow brick road is crumbling. </p>
				<p>Who is to blame for all this evil, for all this chaos? Dorothy.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“This book had so many plot twists, and the characters always have differing personalities throughout the story. It’s a rollercoaster of emotions for me… This version of Dorothy being a cruel, power hungry girl made me hate her so much as a character!!! So Dorothy really must die!!!” –Review by D.Diaries. group member Lyneber Arciaga</p>
